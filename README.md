Course Overview
The Essentials Program focuses on establishing a foundation in the three core areas of the din: islam, iman and ihsan.
Starting with a brief reminder about the importance of sacred knowledge, students study basic Aqidah (Islamic beliefs) and then begin a detailed,
practical study of Hanafi Fiqh, starting with Taharah (purification) and Salah (prayer), and then moving into Sawn (Fasting) and Zakah.
The program also covers a discussion on Following Qualified Scholarship and a module on Purification of the Heart.
